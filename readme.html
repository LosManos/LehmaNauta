<h1>Readme for LehmaNauta</h1>

<p>Version 0.1</p>

<p>This is a simple solution for uploading a document to a server,  <br/>
get a unique id back  <br/>
and then use this unique id to retrieve said file  <br/>
once. Only once.</p>

<p>Typically usage is for sending files to a server somewhere on the internet and said computer and your computer can't share files.</p>

<p>Another, almost equally simple solution, is to upload the file to Google docs, Skydrive or Dropbox and then share the file through a unique URL. This solution does the same but with 2 bonuses:  <br/>
1) it is hosted on Your computer so NSA must get to Your data another way than to just circumvent US laws<br/>
2) the file is downloaded after 1 download or a certain time, whatever comes first.</p>

<p>HTH</p>
