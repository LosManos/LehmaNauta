# Readme for LehmaNauta

Version 0.1

This is a simple solution for uploading a document to a server,  
get a unique id back  
and then use this unique id to retrieve said file  
once. Only once.

Typically usage is for sending files to a server somewhere on the internet and said computer and your computer can't share files.

Another, almost equally simple solution, is to upload the file to Google docs, Skydrive or Dropbox and then share the file through a unique URL. This solution does the same but with 2 bonuses:  
1) it is hosted on Your computer so NSA must get to Your data another way than to just circumvent US laws
2) the file is downloaded after 1 download or a certain time, whatever comes first.
